Here we are, the fruit is mature. Fraise has just been released but this version can possibly instable so please report bugs and remarks concerning it.

Important message:

I have removed every translations that have not been updated because they don't contain references to the new update system. If you want to translate Fraise in your language, please contact me (a big part of the application is already translated in multiple languages so it won't require a lot of time).
